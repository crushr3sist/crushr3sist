**Systems-focused software engineer building fault-tolerant infrastructure and high-performance backends.**

Computer Science @ University of Southern Queensland - last trimester

### What I'm Building

**[BlockFrame](https://github.com/crushr3sist/blockframe-rs)** - Self-hosted erasure-coded storage engine in Rust. Reed-Solomon fault tolerance with transparent FUSE/WinFSP mounting. Built because MinIO requires clusters; this runs on a Raspberry Pi with mathematical guarantees against disk failure.

**[r3almX Backend](https://github.com/crushr3sist/r3almX-backend)** - High-throughput real-time communications platform in Python. Explored architectural patterns that make Python fast enough for real-time messaging at scale (WebSockets, RabbitMQ, Redis caching, microservices).

**[Homely Backend](https://github.com/crushr3sist/homely_backend_go)** - FFMPEG-based HLS streaming service in Go. Rewrote from Node.js when concurrent transcoding became the bottleneck.

### Current Focus

Systems architecture, concurrency patterns, fault-tolerant design, and the practical trade-offs in distributed systems. Particularly interested in problems where single-machine solutions can outperform distributed ones through better engineering.
